## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with **React 18** using TypeScript and follows a modern component-based architecture:
- **UI Framework**: Utilizes shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives for consistent, accessible design
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom VS Code-inspired dark theme variables and color scheme
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management and data fetching
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth page transitions and interactive animations
- **Development**: Vite as the build tool with hot module replacement and TypeScript support

### Backend Architecture
The backend follows an **Express.js** REST API pattern:
- **Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript support
